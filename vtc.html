    <div id="tbox2"><h5 class="subheader">This interview was recorded during Venerable Tenzin’s two-month visit to the Milarepa Center at the end of 2013. Venerable Tenzin talks about getting ordained, her 6 year retreat, her involvement with the Liberation Prison Project and advice for new dharma students.</h5>
    <hr>
    <h5>How long have you been ordained?</h5>
    <p>I got preliminary vows from Lama Zopa in 2003, so I’ve been in robes for just over 10 years. Then I got novice vows from His Holiness in July 2004. But I’ve been interested in Dharma pretty much since I’ve been a hippy teenager in the early 70’s.</p>
	<h5>Is being ordained everything you thought it would be and more?</h5>
    <p>It’s so far beyond what I thought it would be – by far – and I’ve never had a moment of regret. It’s been completely amazing for me. And I’m so glad that my karma shifted in long retreat and I was able to decide to do it in this life.</p>
	<h5>What brought you to the Gelugkpa tradition?</h5>
    <p>Well, I went to Dharamsala because I heard His Holiness lived there and I had this naïve idea that I’d just be able to meet him and we’d work the whole thing out. I was hanging out in McLeod Gange as one does, and walking in the hills I ran into this woman who was staying at Tushita retreat center. There was a 10-day Lam-Rim course starting up the next week and so I took the course.</p>
	<p>It just felt like all these things that I had thought about and had been reading about for decades in my exploration of Buddhism and other traditions all came together in the Lam Rim. It was just this perfect, laid out path.</p>
	<p>So after my first 10 day lam rim course that’s when I became interested in Tibetan Buddhism. I don’t think I had any concept of Gelugkpa; for me it was just about Tibetan Buddhism and the specific techniques, especially all the meditations to do with bodhicitta and compassion – I love that. I had been interested in Buddhism and practicing in different Buddhist traditions before then, but had never really connected with the Tibetan tradition. It was that connection with the Tibetan tradition that was really interesting to me, especially through the example of HHDL. That’s what got me hooked.</p>
	<h5>So did you end up getting to meet His Holiness during your stay in Dharamsala?</h5>
    <p>Yeah and that was a real turning point. He used to give these public blessings and you line up and offer a khata. But I had heard that if you brought something for him to bless, like a photo or your mala, you could be in front of him for an extra couple of seconds. So I did that; I think I had a mala at that point by the time I met him, at that time I was staying at Tushita. Just looking into his eyes and being in his presence was a huge turning point.</p>
	<p>When I went to India, my boss wouldn’t let me quit and he gave me an indefinite leave of absence. But right after meeting His Holiness I wrote my boss a letter and said, “Today I met the Dalai Lama. I’m not coming back.” And that was back in the day of aerograms. You’d get this big blue piece of paper that you folded in a certain way. It turns out that I don’t think my boss actually ever received it because mail in India was so sketchy at that point, so I don’t think he ever actually got it. But that was the shift in my mind of like, forget it, I’m just going to stick around and check this out.</p>
	<p>At that point, like I said, I had taken some Lam-Rim courses but it was really meeting His Holiness that was the big turning point. Like, okay, I’m just going to check this out thoroughly before going back to the states.</p>
	<h5>What job had you just promised not to return to?</h5>
	<p>I had been working and doing hazardous waste management for an environmental engineering company. I have a Master’s degree in biochemistry with a minor in toxicology, and then I got into the field of hazardous waste management and so I was working for an environmental engineering company doing waste cleanup plans and things like that, which I really liked and considered right livelihood. But I kind of was going through an early mid-life crisis and felt like I needed to focus more on my spiritual life. I was just turning 34 that year.</p>
	<h5>You entered a 6-year retreat in 2000. How did you end up doing that?</h5>
	<p>What happened was, I had been working for Lama Zopa for the FPMT International Office and I was feeling like I needed some time to deepen my practice.  So I asked for an appointment to talk to Lama Zopa, and in my mind I was thinking, “Maybe I can take a 6 month leave of absence, do some longer retreat, and then come back. I think I had always been really intrigued by the idea of 3 year retreat.</p>
	<p>And in fact, when I was a hippy teenager I read Be Here Now, which we all did back then, and Autobiography of a Yogi. I remember writing a paper in high school – we had to write about who we emulated and who we wanted to be like – and I wrote this whole paper, I was 16, I wrote about wanting to be a yogi meditating in a cave in the Himalayas. My English teacher made me stay after school to explain it. I thought I was going to get in trouble, but it wasn’t that, it was, “Where on earth does this idea come from, from this suburban high school girl?” But it was because I had read those books and this whole new world had opened up.</p>
	<p>Anyway, I’d always thought it’d be so amazing to do long retreat. So I went to see Lama Zopa Rinpoche and asked him about it. I wanted to know if it came out good to do, where to do, and so forth. Rinpoche went into this long thing of checking with divination, for a really long time, and when he came out of that he said it was really good to do a 3 year retreat. So it sort of blew my mind. I mean, it’s what I always wanted but it wasn’t at all what I was expecting at that point.</p>
    <p>So I did a traditional 3 year, 3 month, 3 day retreat. And then about the last 6 months of that, I wrote to Rinpoche twice. Once because I decided to get ordained the last year of the retreat and I went in as a lay person. And then about a month after that I felt like I really wanted to stay in retreat and so he wrote back and said that that was a good idea. So I moved to another hermitage to continue. And it was like continue as long as it feels right, and it just so happened to be 3 more years.</p>
	<p>Then at the end of that 3 years, it was just feeling for me that it was time to have a phase of being out, of offering service. And that’s when I started teaching.</p>
	<h5>Did you have any notable turning points in your retreat?</h5>
	<p>Well when I decided to get ordained, I think that I had thought that I was a serious dharma practitioner, you know, which in a way I was. But I think I realized in retreat that I really wasn’t committing to the extent that I thought I was. It was like I was still a little bit on the fence, trying to make samsara work and trying to be a good dharma practitioner. And for me, getting off the fence meant getting ordained. I don’t think that’s true for everybody. But for me, that was it: I was still trying to make samsara work and trying to get samsaric happiness and trying to do dharma, and I think the intensity of [retreat] made me realize I just couldn’t do that anymore. I just wasn’t getting anywhere. I was staying stuck.</p>
	<p>The conclusion of that for me was that if I really believe in this path and if I really believe that this path will liberate me from samsara, I have to go for it all the way. Which for me, meant getting ordained. That was a big turning point, yeah. It’s hard for me to imagine having reached that point without having gone into long retreat. Sometimes I think, “Would I be ordained now if I hadn’t done long retreat?” and you know, it’s impossible to say, but I think the intensity of being on retreat made that shift happen.</p>
	<h5>What is your favorite topic to teach on?</h5>
	<p>Oh wow. I really love the relationship between karma and emptiness, and I also really love bodhicitta and thought transformation.</p>
	<p>I was involved for a number of years with the hospice program at Land of Medicine Buddha, and I developed this course that some centers called “Spiritual and Practical Preparation for Death.” I really like teaching that just because it’s so needed – people really don’t have that training, not only how to prepare for death, but how to die consciously.</p>
	<h5>When you’re teaching you often present examples from your work with prison inmates. Can you tell me more about that?</h5>
	<p>I’ve been involved with Liberation Prison Project since late 2006. I’ve gone into prisons not only in North America but also Columbia, Australia, and New Zealand. I try to connect as much as possible, and I just love it. More recently I’ve gotten more involved in helping out the Prison Project and matching penpals with people to write to. That’s one of the biggest functions of the Prison Project. It isn’t just sending in visiting teachers, but actually having corresponding teachers who can write to inmates, just to give them somebody they can talk to about their interest in Buddhism. That’s a big part of what we do.<p>
	<p>For me, it’s enough to realize how sincere so many of these students are and that they don’t have the luxury of driving to a teaching. It’s hard for us to imagine when you are completely dependent on someone coming to you to either teach you or even to send you a book. They have no freedom to seek out the teachings, which often are the only chance at any kind of rehabilitation.  It’s the volunteer programs that have to provide that.<p>
	<p>I’ve seen so much transformation in a lot of the inmates that I’ve taught, and just how hungry they are for the dharma. So I think that’s why I mention it so much in teachings, because it’s such a great example of how the dharma really works. For many of them it’s the only thing that gives them any hope at all in this really desperate situation.  They go for it; they don’t mess around. That’s what is so inspiring; I feel like I’m the one that benefits because they inspire me so much.</p>
	<h5>Can people feel free to get in touch with you if they are interested in having a penpal to correspond with?</h5>
	<p>Absolutely. If they are interested in being a prison penpal, my contact is tenzin@liberationprisonproject.org. You use the address of the prison project, not your personal address. Some people feel nervous about giving out their address, but we don’t do it like that at all. Your confidentiality, privacy, and security is of the utmost importance to us. [The prisoners] write to the prison project office, and their letters are scanned and sent to you as an email attachment. It’s all completely anonymous that way.  Some people choose to write under a pseudonym, and that’s also completely fine. It’s a great service, easy to do, and means the world to these guys.</p>
	<h5>Do you have any general advice for new dharma students?</h5>
	<p>Two things. I find Western people not being patient with themselves, in general. Like they hear about the goal of enlightenment and then, instead of feeling inspired by the vision of that, they immediately start beating themselves up that they’re not perfect yet. We have this culture of low self-esteem and perfectionism which I think is our own biggest obstacle on the spiritual path. Before we’ve even started, we’re discouraged were not perfect yet. So we’re not realizing the process and also not realizing the magnitude of the process. You will see results, but not to expect quick and instant results.</p>
	<p>The other thing that I really see in people is thinking that studying and going to teachings and reading books is all they need to do, and that they don’t need to meditate. There’s such a difference between intellectually understanding something and then getting the realizations of the path. People love to study and go to teachings, but they just won’t sit down on their cushion and meditate. They think they’re equivalent, and they’re not.</p>
	<p>In Buddhism, we talk about learning, contemplation, and meditation as three ways of approaching the teachings. People are very heavy on learning and don’t give enough time to contemplation and meditation. So for people who are very serious, thinking about those things can be very helpful.</p>
	<h5>What about a good book recommendation for students who are interested in learning more and studying the dharma?</h5>
	<p>In May, I got together with my old friend, Karuna Cayton, who gave me his book The Misleading Mind. I’ve been carrying it around with me for months without having a chance to read it, and finally have had the chance. It’s really the essence of buddhadharma. 
One thing that I think is hard for people in the West to deal with is the cultural overlay. I think [Cayton] talks about the essence of Buddhism in a way that we can understand it, without all the culture and ritual. I found more and more that for Buddhism to appeal to Western people, it has to be framed in psychological language, because that’s our world view. So I think Buddhist teachers that are really popular these days are ones that talk about the Buddhist concept in language that we can understand. Not that Buddhism is just psychology, because of course that doesn’t take into account the transcendent aspect of liberation and enlightenment, but just in terms of how to frame the language in explaining things.</p>
<p>So yeah, Karuna Cayton’s book, The Misleading Mind. I also love What Makes You NOT a Buddhist by Dzongar Jamyang Khyenste. Those are the two I often recommend to new students. They both nail the concepts and explain them in a clear way that makes [Buddhism] really accessible.</p>
<h5>When were you last here at Milarepa Center?</h5>
<p>I was here just for a weekend in September 2010, but I had come several times between 2006 and 2008. Lama Zopa Rinpoche had asked me to come by twice a year to teach, if I could. Then, in 2008, Venerable Amy was here and I didn’t need to come anymore. So it’s been more than five years since then.</p>
<h5>What has changed since the last time you were at Milarepa Center?</h5>
<p>Wow, so much has changed. Just physically, a lot has changed. I’ll start by mentioning that. Two little cabins have been built, the two Guru Rinpoche statues, the new alter, the refurbished stupa.</p>
<p>When I was here last as a visiting teacher, there was not a resident director and so there was never really any staff. So what’s changed now is a structure of permanent staff that there never was before, and a resident director, teacher, and an ongoing teaching program. So the students have consistent teachings and are better prepared.</p>
<h5>Any last comments?</h5>
<p>Well I appreciate being here. I’ve had a great time and the students are awesome. Everybody carry on with your practice. Just be kind. (Tenzin Chogkyi gives a big laugh!)</p>
